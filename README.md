# QuotesApp

#### Version 1.0

#### By **James Ngari N.**

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4.

The quotes app displays quotes input by users and allows users to vote for their favourite quotes.

Users can also dislike votes and add their own custom quotes.

The live link to the Quotes app can be found at [quotesApp](https://jay-68.github.io/quotesApp/).

Below is an image preview of the live page
